  <h3 align="center">School Closures and COVID-19, from April 2020</h3>

  <p align="center">
    As countries successively shut down for the pandemic in spring of 2020, public conversation focused on <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">the original Imperial College study</a> of measures to mitigate the virus' spread.  Before revisions, the study's models indicated that the lowest death rates would result from shutting down workplaces and businesses while keeping schools open, a detail often ignored in news articles.  I grew interested in how different countries' policies toward school closures might affect death rates from the disease.  Using data from the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, I designed a study to measure the impact of school closure policies on COVID deaths.
